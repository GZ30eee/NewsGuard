Villagers in Sundarpur, a quiet agricultural settlement nestled at the base of the Sivalik Hills, reported hearing a loud whirring noise followed by a blinding flash of blue light before the object hit the ground in a dry riverbed just outside the village boundary.\n\nThe object, roughly the size of a small car, is made of an unidentified alloy that scientists say doesn't match any known material on Earth. \u201cThe surface is incredibly smooth, almost frictionless, and appears to be absorbing radiation in ways we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Dr. Kavita Rao, a materials scientist from the Indian Institute of Science, who is leading a research team on-site.\n\nLocal authorities quickly cordoned off the area, and within hours, teams from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), and even a joint observer team from the United Nations arrived to secure the location. Speculation about the object's origin has varied wildly\u2014from an experimental space probe to alien technology.\n\nUnexplained Anomalies\n\nAccording to multiple eyewitnesses, the air temperature dropped significantly in the vicinity of the object, and several mobile phones in the area stopped functioning moments after the crash. Farmers working nearby claimed to see \"dancing lights\" around the object before it went completely dark.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing could be consistent with ionizing radiation or magnetic field anomalies,\u201d said Dr. Malik Oberoi, a physicist from the University of Cambridge who was flown in to consult. \u201cHowever, without proper analysis, it's too early to speculate.\u201d\n\nNotably, preliminary scans conducted by ground-penetrating radar revealed that the object may extend several meters underground, suggesting that what is visible on the surface could be just a fraction of a much larger structure.\n\nGovernment Response\n\nThe Indian government has issued a temporary no-fly zone over the region and has dispatched the Indian Army to enforce a security perimeter around Sundarpur. In a brief statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs said, \u201cWe are treating this as an object of scientific interest and potential strategic significance. Citizens are advised not to approach the site.\u201d\n\nDespite official reassurances, conspiracy theories and public concern are already spreading. Social media has been flooded with videos, some showing alleged aerial footage of the object glowing faintly in the dark. A few unverified clips suggest that small drones deployed near the object mysteriously malfunctioned and crashed.", "prediction": "REAL", "confidence": 0.5063467025756836, "fake_probability": 0.4936533570289612, "features": {"sensational_count": 3, "credible_count": 6, "clickbait_count": 0, "exclamation_count": 0, "question_count": 0, "all_caps_count": 2, "suspicious_numbers": 0, "sentence_count": 15, "word_count": 414, "avg_sentence_length": 27.6}, "important_words": [{"word": "object", "importance": 0.30303030303030304}, {"word": "indian", "importance": 0.12121212121212122}, {"word": "sundarpur", "importance": 0.09090909090909091}, {"word": "said", "importance": 0.09090909090909091}, {"word": "research", "importance": 0.09090909090909091}, {"word": "india", "importance": 0.06060606060606061}, {"word": "village", "importance": 0.06060606060606061}, {"word": "small", "importance": 0.06060606060606061}, {"word": "surface", "importance": 0.06060606060606061}, {"word": "radiation", "importance": 0.06060606060606061}], "explanation": {"summary": "This article has mixed characteristics, making it difficult to determine its credibility with high confidence.", "factors": [{"type": "negative", "description": "Contains 3 sensational terms or phrases (e.g., 'shocking', 'miracle', '100% effective')."}, {"type": "positive", "description": "Contains 6 terms associated with credible reporting (e.g., 'research', 'study', 'evidence')."}, {"type": "positive", "description": "Substantial article length (414 words), providing more detailed information."}], "recommendations": ["Always verify information from multiple credible sources.", "Check if the article cites specific sources, studies, or experts.", "Look for the original source of claims or statistics mentioned.", "Be cautious of articles that use emotional or sensational language."]}, "timestamp": "2025-05-04T14:25:11.948836"}
